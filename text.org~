* Mapping Meditation Project

We are mapping meditation 'space' using consumer EEG (Muse), powered by open-source AI analysis, made free to all meditators to help their journey. 

Early results showed that strong meditators (> 5 year experience) have consistent, large gamma-wave increases at similar parts of their brains. Different meditation traditions targeted different parts of the brain.

Currently we have an Android app for recording EEG during meditation, paired with a companion website which analyzes the data, highlighting typical changes of strong meditation.

Long-term participants are thrilled with their results. Simply exploring their data after each meditation, comparing their results with previous results and with other particpants, helped them identify important moments during their meditation, increasing their confident, resulting in rapid progress.
